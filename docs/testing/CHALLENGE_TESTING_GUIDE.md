# Challenge Builder - Testing Guide

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the Challenge Builder feature, including functional testing, user interface validation, export functionality, and edge case handling.

## Feature Summary

The Challenge Builder allows users to create standardized challenge cards with:
- Challenge pools (1-12 dice)
- Challenge titles with special typography
- Multi-line traits and moves
- Optional failure conditions with pools and descriptions
- Professional card export functionality

## Test Plan

**Objective:** Verify pool input accepts valid ranges and handles invalid input

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Challenge Builder tab
2. Test pool input field:
   - Enter values 1-12 (should accept)
   - Enter 0 (should clamp to 1)
   - Enter 13+ (should clamp to 12)
   - Enter negative numbers (should clamp to 1)
   - Enter non-numeric text (should ignore/reset)

**Expected Results:**
- Pool values stay within 1-12 range
- Invalid inputs are automatically corrected
- Card preview updates immediately with valid values

#### Test 1.2: Title Input and Display
**Objective:** Verify title input and special typography rendering

**Steps:**
1. Enter various title formats:
   - Single word: "Goblin"
   - Multiple words: "Goblin Raider Attack"
   - Special characters: "Goblin's Den!"
   - Long titles: "Very Long Challenge Title That Tests Wrapping"
2. Observe card preview typography

**Expected Results:**
- All characters accepted in title field
- Card displays title with initcap styling (larger first letters)
- Long titles wrap appropriately
- Special characters display correctly

#### Test 1.3: Traits Input Processing
**Objective:** Verify multi-line trait input and bullet list display

**Steps:**
1. Enter traits in various formats:
   - Single trait: "Sneaky"
   - Multiple traits (one per line):
     ```
     Sneaky
     Cowardly
     Pack Tactics
     ```
   - Empty lines mixed with content
   - Trailing/leading whitespace

**Expected Results:**
- Each non-empty line becomes a bullet point
- Empty lines are ignored
- Whitespace is trimmed
- Traits display with âœ± symbols and italic formatting

#### Test 1.4: Moves Input Processing
**Objective:** Verify multi-line moves input and special formatting

**Steps:**
1. Enter moves in various formats:
   - Single move: "Ambush"
   - Multiple moves:
     ```
     Surprise Attack
     Flee when outnumbered
     Call for reinforcements
     ```
   - Long move descriptions
   - Mixed case text

**Expected Results:**
- Each non-empty line becomes a bullet point
- Moves display with â—‰ symbols
- Text appears in bold, all caps
- First letters of each word are larger (initcap)

### 2. Failure Conditions Testing

#### Test 2.1: Failure Pool Validation
**Objective:** Verify failure pool input and conditional display

**Steps:**
1. Test failure pool values:
   - Set to 0 (should hide failure section)

   - Test invalid values (should clamp to 0-12)

**Expected Results:**
- Pool 0 hides failure section regardless of description
- Pool 1-12 shows failure section only with description
- Invalid values are automatically corrected

#### Test 2.2: Failure Description
**Objective:** Verify failure description input and display

**Steps:**
1. Test failure description scenarios:
   - Empty description with pool > 0 (should hide failure)
   - Valid description with pool > 0 (should show failure)
   - Valid description with pool = 0 (should hide failure)

**Expected Results:**
- Failure section only appears when both pool > 0 AND description exists
- Failure displays with âœ˜ symbol and bold formatting
- Description text appears after pool notation

### 3. Form Controls Testing
